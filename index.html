	<h1>Hello! My name is Mehreen Rashid</h1>
		
		<p>
			I, Mehreen Rashid, graduated from high school in 2019 under the certifications of O & A levels from Cambridge Board of Education. Since 2017, right after my o levels, I have been working as a part time teacher as I always loved teaching and wanted to enjoy some moments of it before I actually start my journey as a professional barrister. Yes, haha, you read it right, my main goal is to become a barrister and work for the law. I have had this dream since I was a toddler of 7. My father always wanted me to become a barrister and that's how I inherited this dream and made it my own. </p>
		<p>
			You must be wondering, if I want to become a barrister what am I doing here in this course with you. The answer to that question is I absolutely love learning new things and exploring my options in my career path. Life always does not turn out as you plan it to be, right? I started this journey towards freelancing during the year 2018 when I joined the graphics designing course from an institute called "Shikhbe Shobai." One of my elder sisters encouraged me to start this journey and here I am done with graphics design, ui/ux design and now getting to know the world of development and coding.

			I love learning new things and polishing my skills as much as I can. This obsession began as I like more and more titles to be added to my résumé as I continue my life. I still have plans to become a barrister and I am a first year law student under the University of London. Thank you for reading me while I blabber through three paragraphs of my life!
